# Contact Manager GUI

## Concerned Courses
This project was developed in parallel with the following course as the *term-project*:
* **CSC 2303:** Advanced Programming/ Object Oriented Programming

The graphical user interface portrays a Contact Manager while the rest of the project is somewhat of a messaging application that was not completed due to us having no prior experience with servers.

## Introduction
This contact manager GUI WAS made using the concepts of Object Oriented Design. Minimal and fairly simple code is written in the GUI *(no designer was used)*. This project was designed as the term-project during the course "**Advanced Programming/ Object Oriented Programming CS2303**".

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Keep in mind that this is a **beginner's** graphical user interface, which served as practice in order to gain familliarity with the `Java Swing Library`.
